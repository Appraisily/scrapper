# Implementation Summary - GCS Storage Configuration Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Default Bucket Name
- Modified `SearchStorageService` constructor in `src/utils/search-storage.js` to use "invaluable-html-archive-images" as the default bucket name instead of "invaluable-html-archive".
- This ensures that when no explicit bucket is provided, the service will use the correct bucket.

### 2. Enhanced File Existence Checking
- Improved the `pageResultsExist` method to add better logging when files already exist
- Added a new `imageExists` method to properly check if an image already exists in GCS before attempting to download it
- This prevents unnecessary downloads and API calls for images that are already stored

### 3. Optimized Image Saving Process
- Updated the `saveImage` method to use the new `imageExists` method to avoid redownloading images that are already stored
- Improved error handling in the process by returning null with a warning instead of throwing an error for missing parameters

### 4. Verified API Integration
- Confirmed that the search.js route handlers correctly handle the bucket parameter passed from the client
- Both the GET and POST routes already had code to create a custom storage instance with the specified bucket name

## Testing

To verify the changes, we created a `bucket_config_test.js` script that:
1. Tests the bucket name configuration with different settings
2. Confirms file path construction is correct for both page JSONs and images
3. Verifies the path structure matches what we want in our GCS buckets

## Next Steps

1. **Deployment**: 
   - Deploy these changes to the Cloud Run service
   - Don't forget to rebuild and redeploy the container

2. **Testing**: 
   - After deployment, run a small test with a few keywords to verify:
     - JSON files are correctly saved to the expected bucket and path
     - Images are correctly saved to their respective folders
     - Existing images are not redownloaded

3. **Production Run**:
   - Once verified, run the full keyword processing script:
     ```
     nohup ./process_all_KWs.sh > process_all_KWs.out 2>&1 &
     ```

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Watch the Cloud Run logs for any errors
   - Periodically check `processed_KWs.log` to see progress
   - Verify in the GCS bucket that files are being saved correctly

These changes ensure the JSON files and images will all be stored in the same bucket with a consistent folder structure, while avoiding redundant downloads of existing images.
